# Example Data Science Project in Clojure

This is an example data science project to demonstrate data tasks using Clojure tools and ibraries.

## Rationale
- Clojure is fun and joyful and data science is fun and joyful, so let's put them together!
- Data science tasks in R and Python are joyful due to the accessibility and velocity of development for practitioners and learners.
- The story of Clojure is the story of a [Lisp on Java/JS](https://clojure.org/about/rationale), building [long running, situated programs](https://download.clojure.org/papers/clojure-hopl-iv-final.pdf), broad reach provided by the host languages (Java and JS) and bridges to other runtimes (Python, R, etc...). The pitch for Clojure is simplicity at the heart of software development. See [Simple Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKtk3HCgTa8).
- It's my conjecture that the complexity at the heart of data science and operationalizing data products, this intersection of ML Engineering, ML Ops, and software development best practices will continue to grow, entangle, and become ripe for opportunities to simplify (see [Operationalizing Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09125)).
- Based on that conjecture, I believe there is significant value to be found in Clojure's approach to simplicity, especially in the data science space.

## Prerequisites
- [Install Java](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure#java)
- [Install Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure)

## Recommended Editor
- The lowest barrier to entry editor setup I'm aware of is using https://code.visualstudio.com/ and the remarkable and powerful [Calva](https://calva.io/) extension.
- Clojure practitioners strongly recommend developing using an editor with an integrated REPL. The [official docs](https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction) share a guide and there are many [threads and conversations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/sm80ed/why_is_clojures_repl_better_than_other_dynamic/) about the benefits.
- Quite a few learning resources recommend [Emacs](https://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/), [Cursive on IntelliJ](https://cursive-ide.com/), or other bespoke editor solutions. 
- Simplest solution: use VS Code with Calva.

## What We'll Be Doing
- Analyzing the HR Attrition dataset.
- Tablecloth
- Fastmath
- Visualizations

## Thanks
 I'm thankful for the encouragement, guidance, and resources from [SciCloj Community](https://scicloj.github.io/), and I am grateful for the authors and maintainers of these tools.
